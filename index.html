	Unfortunately. Github has an anti file upload policy and will not let me use
	Javascript or PHP for serverside transfers. SO I have a more of a... pain in
	the ass solution. There is an app Github has to upload files manually
	<a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is more of
	a pain to do but I will have all these links displaying on each page instead for
	live streaming of data. Sorry about this! I will see if I can find a way around it.
